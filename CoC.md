**The Improv Hacker / Whose Slide Is It Anyway Code of Conduct

**What Is WSIIA?

We make slide decks about any possible thing/combination of things we can think of. Then, we let contestants give their best Subject Matter Expert interpretation of the content. If they don't suck, they get prizes. Or if they suck worse than anyone who's ever competed, they'll still get prizes. We've got a lot of stuff that rand0h doesn't want to haul back East. 

The Improv Hacker WSIIA crew have worked hard to make this contest a fun and relaxing experience for all attendees. We almost put "pleasant" in there, but let’s face it, some of our contestants will make you question your will to live. We believe in the power of laughter to ease & heal the wrongs of the world. Our charter is simple, to bring people together & watch each other fail & flail miserably on stage for the enjoyment of others.  

**What Do We Want from You?

Common decency and common sense. What do we mean by that? This event succeeds only through the creativity and willingness of its participants. Everyone, from the show runners to the contestants to the general audience play a pivotal role in bringing the funny. 

**What Will We Do?

We will give the contestants, judges & staff free reign to be their most creative selves both in the creation and delivery of content and topics in the slide decks. Much of it is irreverent, weird, confusing and frightening to everyone regardless of background. We like it that way. That being said, there are rules. We will never deliberately create content that marginalizes, demeans, or otherwise threatens anyone’s personal space and safety. We will take all feedback and criticism under advisement and will provide you with an avenue to give that feedback.

**What won't we put up with?

Improv Hacker / WSIIA cannot and will not be responsible for what comes out of our contestants’ mouths. Be it hilarious, cringeworthy or otherwise WTF. While we will never be able to anticipate what contestants might say, we will not, under any circumstances, tolerate hate speech meant to incite violence or lessen the humanity of our attendees. Anything that denigrates someone’s age, race, color, religion, sex, gender/genderless, national origin, disability status, protected veteran status, or any other characteristic that might attempt to demean or undermine a person’s value in our community. Language that violates that rule will be dealt with swiftly and severely.

What do we mean by swiftly and severely? There will be no warning or quarter given to offenders. We will employ any means necessary to bounce your dumb ass off the stage and away from the mic if you even think about attempting to fuck with our people and our contest. We will then make sure DEF CON knows what you did and let them handle you accordingly. No one is above being removed permanently from our contest, including its creators, organizers and judges. 

**In Conclusion:

We must all police ourselves and understand that we all come from different cultures, and backgrounds, which is something this contest is meant to celebrate/exploit (Slides about Animal Husbandry are hilarious in any language). We want people to enjoy themselves. We want them to feel included. If, for any reason, they feel threatened or fear for their well-being, we want them to have a clear workflow for reporting. Report any concerns to randoh (@dakacki) directly, if you can't find him, grab a DEF CON Goon and they'll help find him for you.  Otherwise, any issues, comments, questions, slide deck suggestions and bribes can be directed to rand0h (@dakacki @ImprovHacker) via Twitter DM, in person or over email to randoh at pcwf dot co.

In short. Don't be a dick. In return, we will never (intentionally) be dicks. If you think we're being dicks, tell us about it. If you're being a dick, we'll take swift action to remove you so we can go back to having fun without you.
