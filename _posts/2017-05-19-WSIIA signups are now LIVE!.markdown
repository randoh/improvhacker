Our little carnival of madness will be running Friday, Saturday and a very special "Hangover Edition" on Sunday morning! And by special we mean it'll be awesome if nobody dies in the middle of presenting. Not that we have a death pool going or anything. 

We'll be taking both pre-registered and day of contestants. HOWEVER, if you want to secure your spot for a chance some some awesome swag from our gracious sponsors then make your mark. Let's get weird.
