&lt;p&gt;The How: Our team of slide monkeys will create 20 short decks on whatever nonsense tickles our fancy that week. Slides are not exclusive to technology, they can and will be about anything. Contestants will take the stage and choose a random number corresponding to a specific slide deck.  They will then improvise a five-minute lightning talk, becoming instant subject matter experts on whatever topic/stream of consciousness appears on the screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Why: Whether you delight in the chaos of watching your fellow hackers squirm or would like to sacrifice yourself to the Demo Gods, it’s a night of schadenfreude for the whole family.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">The What: “Whose Slide Is It Anyway?”” is an unholy union of impov comedy, hacking and slide deck sado-masochism.</summary></entry></feed>
